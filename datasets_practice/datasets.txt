''Myocardial interstitial fibrosis is a common pathological feature in many cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure and atrial fibrillation''


GSE225336 contains RNA-seq and ATAC-seq from primary human cardiac fibroblasts treated with / without TGFBETA1 (important mediator of fibrosis)


RNA-seq for gene expression changes --------------------|
                                                           * how variants may operate 
ATAC-seq for changes in chromatin accessibility(?) -----|
