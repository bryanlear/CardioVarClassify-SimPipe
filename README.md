\section{VAE for Synthetic Genetic Data Generation (Component of CardioVarClassify-SimPipe)}

Primary aim of VAE is to learn from real genetic sequences and generate synthetic data. Data generated by VAE will serve as controlled dataset for testing robustness / behaviour of downstream model

\textbf{To define:} Encoder to map input sequences to parameters of $q_\theta(Z|X)$, $Z$ (Latent Space) with $P_\lambda(Z) (prior distribution), Decoder to map points from $Z$ back to generate sequence data.
With PyTorch framework

\textbf{Synthetic Data Generation & VUS Characteristic Control}

\begin{itemize}
	\item VUS Control Strategies:
	begin{enumerate}
		\item Generate and post-hoc: Identify variants within and classify (e.g., SnpEff/VEP for annotation, ClinVar, gnomAD for frequency, in \textit{silico predictors: '...provide computational predictions about the likely effect of the variant, which can then be combined with other evidence (e.g., population frequency, clinical data) to help determine the overall likelihood that the variant is disease-causing.\*' }) to determine VUS status and prevalence.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Select or filter generated sequences to achieve the desired low VUS prevalence for the synthetic dataset.
	\item Look into conditional VAE (if labeled data available), latent space manipulation, reinforcement learning
\end{itemize}
