**How Pillars Connect to Build a System like Emedgene:**

1.  **Data Foundation:**
    * **NLP (Pillar 2)** processes vast amounts of literature.
    * **Phenotype Data (Pillar 5)** from patients is standardized (e.g., using HPO).
    * This information, along with genomic databases (like ClinVar, OMIM - mentioned under **Pillar 3A**), forms the raw material.

2.  **Knowledge Structuring:**
    * **Knowledge Graphs (Pillar 3)** integrate these diverse data types into a structured, interconnected network representing biological and clinical knowledge.

3.  **Predictive Intelligence:**
    * **Machine Learning models (Pillar 1)**, including deep learning, are trained on this structured knowledge (from KGs) and raw variant data.
    * These models predict pathogenicity, prioritize variants, and identify potential disease links, often leveraging insights from **phenotype data (Pillar 5)**.
    * ML on KGs (**Pillar 3B**) can help infer new relationships or score existing ones.

4.  **Clinical Trust & Utility:**
    * **Explainable AI (Pillar 4)** methods are applied to make the ML model's outputs understandable and trustworthy for clinicians.
    * The system aims to provide evidence and reasoning that aligns with established clinical frameworks like the **ACMG/AMP guidelines (Pillar 1D)**.
